# 🕵️ Spy Word Game

A multiplayer web-based game combining elements of Spyfall and Kahoot, where players try to identify the spies among them while spies try to blend in without knowing the secret word.

## 🎮 Game Overview

**Spy Word Game** is a real-time multiplayer social deduction game where:
- **Civilians** receive a secret word and must discuss it without revealing it to spies
- **Spies** don't know the word and must try to blend in by participating in the discussion
- **Host** manages the game session and controls timing
- **Everyone** tries to figure out who the spies are before time runs out

### Game Flow
1. **Setup**: Host creates a game session with custom duration (5-60 minutes)
2. **Lobby**: Players join via URL/QR code and wait for game start
3. **Assignment**: Spies are randomly selected (1 spy per 3 players minimum)
4. **Discussion**: Players discuss the secret word while spies try to blend in
5. **Revelation**: When time expires, spies are revealed

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Public Testing with ngrok

#### Step-by-Step Setup for ngrok Account Holders

1. **Install ngrok** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npm install -g ngrok
   ```

2. **Authenticate** (one-time setup - you've already done this!):
   ```bash
   ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```

3. **Start your game server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **In a new terminal, start ngrok**:
   ```bash
   # Basic tunnel (recommended for testing)
   ngrok http 3000
   
   # Or with custom subdomain (if available on your plan)
   ngrok http 3000 --subdomain=spy-word-game
   
   # Or with custom domain (if you have one configured)
   ngrok http 3000 --domain=your-domain.ngrok-free.app
   ```

5. **Share the URL**: Copy the HTTPS URL from ngrok output (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`) and share it with players

#### Benefits with Your ngrok Account
- ✅ **No time limits**: Sessions don't expire after 2 hours
- ✅ **Better performance**: Priority routing and faster connections
- ✅ **Access logs**: See connection details in your ngrok dashboard
- ✅ **Custom domains**: Use consistent URLs (if configured)
- ✅ **HTTPS included**: Automatic SSL certificates

#### Alternative: ngrok Web Interface
If the command line isn't working, you can also:
1. Visit [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/tunnels/agents)
2. Download the ngrok agent for Windows
3. Run it with a GUI interface

## 🎯 Game Rules & Strategy

### For Civilians
- **Know the word** but don't say it directly
- **Ask questions** that only word-knowers would understand
- **Watch for confusion** from players who seem lost
- **Build consensus** on who seems suspicious

### For Spies
- **Listen carefully** to pick up clues about the word
- **Ask safe questions** that work for any topic
- **Deflect suspicion** by participating naturally
- **Coordinate subtly** with other spies (if multiple)

### For Hosts
- **Manage timing** based on group dynamics
- **Extend lobby** if more players are coming
- **Start new rounds** to keep the game going
- **Moderate discussions** if needed (external to game)

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- Nickname length and character restrictions
- Game duration bounds checking
- Session ID format validation
- Basic XSS prevention in text inputs

### Session Management
- Secure random session ID generation
- Host-only administrative controls
- Automatic cleanup of abandoned sessions
- Rate limiting on session creation

### Network Security
- HTTPS recommended for production
- CORS headers configured appropriately
- Socket.io namespace isolation
- Input sanitization on all user data

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Connection Failed"**
- Check if server is running on correct port
- Verify firewall settings allow connections
- Ensure WebSocket support in browser

**"Session Not Found"**
- Session may have expired or been closed
- Check URL for typos in session ID
- Host may have aborted the game

**"Audio Not Working"**
- Browser may block autoplay audio
- User interaction required to enable audio
- Check browser's audio permissions

**"Notifications Not Showing"**
- Browser notification permissions required
- May not work in private/incognito mode
- iOS Safari has limited notification support

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable debug logging
DEBUG=socket.io* npm start

# Or set environment variable
export DEBUG=socket.io*
node server.js
```

### Log Analysis
```bash
